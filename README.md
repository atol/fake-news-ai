# Fake News AI

A fake news detector developed as part of the Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News? competition and CMPT 415 course. 
The goal was to implement an AI algorithm that correctly labels a given claim as `true`, `partly true` or `false`.

The program takes as input a metadata file with information about a series of claims and an empty `label` field for each claim. 
The output is a predictions file with a rating of `true`, `partly true` or `false` in the `label` field for each claim.

Various techniques for identifying fake news were used, including machine learning and deep learning methods.
