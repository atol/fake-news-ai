Buffalo is a small town in Missouri located just around thirty miles outside of the larger city of Springfield. It's a peaceful town, tranquil and filled with many friendly locales who rarely leave the town in fear that civilization might gobble them up. Tom Cruise announced today in an interview that he was \"tired of all the bright lights and paparazzi\" and that he wanted \"a new beginning.\" He recently visited Buffalo after getting lost on his way to a bar. \"Everything is so orderly there.\" Tom told People magazine in a recent interview, \"The people all wear the same clothes, drive the same trucks, and shop at the same Walmart.....it's beautiful.\"\n\nTom says one of the main aspects of the town drawing him in is the amazing food selection available. He visited a small chinese restaurant known as \"Sims\" and claimed it was the best food he'd ever had. \"I unloaded my bowels violently for days\" Mr Cruise told us in a phone interview, \"The food must be loaded with fiber and many other healthy nutrients.\" He is excited to try the town's two other restaurant options; Pizza Hut and Hip Pocket Pizza. Tom told interviewers it looked like most other business' were closed down, but was hoping his presence in the town would boost the local economy","claimant":"","date":"2016-07-27","label":0,"related_articles":[114640,125989],"id":16387},{"claim":"\"I committed to public financing; (Obama) committed to public financing.\"","claimant":"John McCain","date":"2008-02-20","label":1,"related_articles":[82760,2436,77084],"id":6631},{"claim":"Says Gov.

It is a little long but what this mother experienced here in Rochester needs to get out to the public fast so it does not happen to anyone else. Please share.\n\nIm going to share the scariest moment of my life to spread awareness that this is in our community and in our lives.\n\nThis happened on July 4th 2016 Silver Lake Park In Rochester, MN at the fire work show.\n\nMy family and I attended the fire work show with one of my closest friends and her children. We walked along the path next to the graveyard and river to get there and found a spot right next to the stage, immediately my youngest, their dad myself and 2 others went to get some concessions for the show. I left my daughter Amora with my friend and her other 2 kids.\n\nI got a text from her saying \"Amora wants mom and dad\". We returned and the show had already started. Took our seats and watched the show. After the finale a stage lit up and a young man started singing catchy songs- this immediately caught all of our attentions and we were like lets go! Our boyfriends didn't feel the same and wanted to walk home before the crowds started pouring out. We separated and headed to the stage with our total 5 children to join the fun. Our kids were LOVING the show, dancing, singing , jumping with joy so i took out my phone to record the fun. As i was recording i put my phone down because i noticed out of 300+ people there was ONE man who stuck out. He was a 40-50 year old Arab man who was standing completely still, right behind my daughter. He looked blank in every way possible. He noticed that i had noticed him and we locked eyes, i pulled my 4 year old away from him and she was upset that i had taken her view of the stage away so she started dancing again. Then he was right behind her again, but this time he pulled out his phone and took her picture, i launched at him and he started to walk away but as he walked away from me he grabbed Amora's head to see if she would willingly come with him. NO WAY i ran after this man. I screamed for him and he pretended not to hear me, i finally touched him and he turned around. I yelled at him and tried to take his phone he replied \" sorry she is just so beautiful with a disgusting SMIRK on his face, then out of the dark path way two older men ( also middle eastern ) emerged and stood behind him firmly. I screamed at him for touching my daughter and demanded the phone back, i told him i was calling the cops he said \"OO so scary\" in a mocking tone. I then got furious and said their dad was going to beat the crap out of them, he responded with \" he is not here though\" immediately i became panicked they had been watching us, i was thinking there was more of them in the group and turned around to get my babies. After this incident we got the hell out of there. My friend and i took our babies and got home, we then talked about what had happened. I found it SO odd that she texted me \"Amora wants her mom and Dad\" she had sent me that text because the older 2 arab men that appeared from the dark path had been sitting behind us the entire show. With their videos out and acting in strange matter that made her feel extremely uncomfortable with their pacing and their watching . They had watched our men walk away and sent the 3rd man into the crowd with us. It was so busy and noisy no one even noticed me screaming at this man, not one single person. And believe me i was SCREAMING at him trying to cause a scene. I called the police to report what happened because i have been a MESS since that night and i cannot get myself together mentally. The police and i went over the entire story and they confirmed it was 100% a kidnapping attempt, these men sell little girls into sex trafficking. I cannot explain how hard this is to even type for me but i hope it helps others. This IS REAL. This happened where i have been watching fire works for 24 years in \"small rochester\"\n\nThey go to big events so they go unnoticed\nThey target women without men and force them into situations where they are separated\nThey try to make a bond with your child to lure them willingly without a scene if possible.\nThey work in groups of 3 or more\nThey take your children and sell them into sex trafficking.\n\nNo i am not okay, and i wont be for a very long time. Had i not noticed what was going on- my baby girl would be gone forever. I cant stomach that one bit- i have been getting help and come home a giant mess every single day and have almost now called into work all week due to have anxiety. Every time i look at her i cry. It was bath night last night and i crawled in the bath with her and cried and she is very confused what is wrong with me. This post i hope is shared by many and taken very seriously.\n\nLOOK FOR THE SIGNS, DONT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE OVER REACTING.\nWATCH YOUR CHILDREN LIKE A HAWK and dont ever for a second let your guard down.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, July 2015","claimant":"","date":"2016-10-23","label":0,"related_articles":[125056,125112,125339,125593,125791,125967,126837],"id":16730},{"claim":"McCain intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators... that allowed Keating to continue his fraud at an incredible cost to taxpayers.","claimant":"Barack Obama","date":"2008-10-06","label":1,"related_articles":[71016,68053],"id":14307},{"claim":"Beer drinking is not allowed in any Illinois state parks.","claimant":"Howard Marklein","date":"2015-03-03","label":0,"related_articles":[96220,5944,81151,4634],"id":13200},{"claim":"Rush Limbaugh accused President Obama and the Democrats of recruiting lesbian farmers to \"attack\" conservative rural areas of the U.S.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDid Rush Limbaugh actually say that Obama is giving lesbian farmers money to attack red states?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via email, August 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-08-24","label":2,"related_articles":[108532,109987,110347,124455,143573],"id":15544},{"claim":"\"Navy destroyer strikes a building in downtown Houston.\"","claimant":"Bloggers","date":"2017-09-01","label":0,"related_articles":[799,1834,35908,537,89510],"id":4653},{"claim":"Donald Trump will be a \"part-time President\" and keep his job on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOh please, please tell me this isn't true.

It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold \u2013 it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith.\n\u00a0\nWe are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don\u2019t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed.\n\nWe point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organization for the right to do so.\n\nOthers would add that money paid to ANY Muslim 'organization' (and you had better believe it: these people ARE 'organized') can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary.\n\nWhat other assurances do we accept from Muslims?\n\nOh, that's right, 'Islam is a religion of PEACE'!\n\nHow less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?\"\n\nThis is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Australia\/NewZealand are bullying large commercial organizations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organizations (Cadbury\/ Schweppes\/ Nestles\/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats.\n\nOf course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury's chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam.\nThe Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference - but give them time.\n\nSeveral state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department's current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England.\n\nHow many more warnings do people need?\n\nCheck the produce on the shelf and don't buy anything Muslim extorted.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, June 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-06-08","label":0,"related_articles":[117299,117300],"id":5210},{"claim":"\"If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent.\"","claimant":"Carly Fiorina","date":"2015-08-09","label":1,"related_articles":[90821,6742,79757],"id":8496},{"claim":"Fruit must be eaten on an empty stomach in order for the body to absorb it properly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nEATING FRUIT\nWe all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat.\n\nWhat is the correct way of eating fruits?\n\nIT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! * FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.\n\nIf you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.\n\nFRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.\n\nLet's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.\n\nIn the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid. The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.\n\nSo please eat your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals! You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and\nproduces gas and hence you will bloat!\n\nGraying hair, balding, nervous outburst, and dark circles under the eyes all these will not happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.\n\nThere is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the Secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.\n\nWhen you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste. Cooking destroys all the vitamins.\n\nBut eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.\n\nYou can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look!\n\nKIWI: Tiny but mighty.

Ludwig lived most of his adult life in Connecticut. His SSN begins with the digits 042, which are among those reserved for Connecticut residents. Obama never lived or worked in that state, so there is no reason for his SSN to start with the digits 042.\n\nNow comes the best part. Ludwig spent the final months of his life in Hawaii, where he died. Conveniently, Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham, worked part-time in the Probate Office in the Honolulu Hawaii Courthouse, and therefore had access to the SSNs of deceased individuals. The Social Security Administration was never informed of Ludwig's death, and because he never received Social Security benefits there were no benefits to stop and no questions were raised.

Can you believe the nerve of these people? It's almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into Mexico. Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson to complain about Arizona's new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.\n\nIt seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off.\n \nA delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday to state that Arizona's new Employer Sanctions Law will have a devastating effect on the Mexican state.\n\nAt a news conference, the legislators said that Sonora \u2014 Arizona's southern neighbor, made up of mostly small towns \u2014 cannot handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA without jobs or money.\n\n\nThe Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business license.\n\nThe Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government. 'How can Arizona pass a law like this?' asked Mexican Rep Leticia Amparano-Gamez, who represents Nogales.\n\n'There is not one person living in Sonora who does not have a friend or relative working in Arizona,' she said, speaking in Spanish. 'Mexico is not prepared for this, for the tremendous problems it will face as more and more Mexicans working in Arizona and who were sending money to their families return to their home-towns in Sonora without jobs,' she said. 'We are one family, socially and economically,' she said of the people of Sonora and Arizona.\n\nWrong!\n\nThe United States is a sovereign nation, not a subsidiary of Mexico, and its taxpayers are not responsible for the welfare of Mexico's citizens.\n\nIt's time for the Mexican government, and its citizens, to stop feeding parasitically off the United States and to start taking care of its\/their own needs.\n\n\nToo bad that other states within the USA don't pass a law just like that passed by Arizona .\n\nMaybe that's the answer, since our own Congress will do nothing! \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Email, May 2008","claimant":"","date":"2017-03-01","label":2,"related_articles":[103854,109535,121417,123786],"id":1800},{"claim":"\"One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever.\"","claimant":"Ted Cruz","date":"2015-12-15","label":0,"related_articles":[93349,79895,88599,88613,34315],"id":7178},{"claim":"\"About 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether.\"","claimant":"Mitch McConnell","date":"2017-01-09","label":1,"related_articles":[77739,78393,7792],"id":17026},{"claim":"The Fraternal Order of Police have retracted their endorsement of Donald Trump.","claimant":"","date":"2016-10-23","label":0,"related_articles":[123686,161627,161721],"id":7531},{"claim":"\u201cI note that we\u2019ve never, even in the days of tsarist Russia, killed people for dissent.

As mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken 3 times a day, any chronic cholesterol is cured. As per information received in the said journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol.\n\nCOLDS: Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1\/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This process will cure most chronic cough, cold and clear the sinuses.\n\nUPSET STOMACH: Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root.\n\nGAS: According to the studies done in India & Japan, it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas.\n\nIMMUNE SYSTEM: Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks. Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts.\n\nConstant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacteria and viral diseases.\n\nINDIGESTION: Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food, relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals.\n\nINFLUENZA: A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient which kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from flu.\n\nLONGEVITY: Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age.

I AM SO MAD! \n\nWhat does this word mean? Dhimmitude\n\nThe word \"Dhimmitude\" is found in the new health care bill. So what does it mean? Obama used it in the health care bill . Now isn't this interesting? It is also included in the health care law.\n\nDhimmitude. I had never heard the word until now, so I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting! It's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists.....it is a REAL word.\n\nDhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslin populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presenceAND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam!\n\nObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States!\n\nMuslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured! Islam considers insurance to be \"gambling,\" \"risk-taking,\" and \"usury\" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.\n\nHow convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de-facto government insurance. \n\nNon-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.\n\nAmerican citizens need to know about it...... Every non-Muslim in the United States of America needs to know about it. \n\n\n\nObamaCare discriminates against Christians and Jews by denying them special exemptions extended to other religions.\n\nIf you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a \"conscientious objection\" to insurance. A conscientious objection to theft committed by rouge politicians under the color of law with the threat of violence for non-compliance isn\u2019t sufficient in America today to exempt average Americans from the stranglehold of government. Believe it or not, if you are a Muslim you may claim a special religious exemption to Obama-Care that is denied to main-stream Christians and Jews. Or if you prefer a New-Age religion to Islam, you may become a Scientologist and Opt Out of ObamaCare\u2019s mandatory purchase of health insurance. Or, if you happen to be of Native American Indian extraction you too can opt out of the insurance laws by which everyone else in America must abide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, April 2010","claimant":"","date":"2016-04-13","label":0,"related_articles":[108122,116389],"id":9574},{"claim":"Actor Matthew McConaughey co-owns a cattle ranch in Texas that offers canned deer hunts.","claimant":"","date":"2015-02-05","label":2,"related_articles":[112244,114524,114604,118373,121056,121287],"id":8282},{"claim":"Says \"the cascading effects\" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS.","claimant":"Martin O'Malley","date":"2015-09-10","label":1,"related_articles":[88201,77826,10120,6029,7623],"id":1956},{"claim":"A University of Texas \"student pulled out a concealed handgun\" on a knife-wielding suspect \"and made him back down.\"","claimant":"Bloggers","date":"2017-05-02","label":0,"related_articles":[13991,43816,59562,559,15864],"id":7770},{"claim":"\"It is not coincidental that there was a massive increase in mass shootings in this country after 2004,\u201d when the assault weapon ban expired","claimant":"Chris Murphy","date":"2016-06-15","label":1,"related_articles":[58732,80613],"id":14747},{"claim":"Says Denmark\u2019s suicide rate has been about twice as high as the United States\u2019 over the past five decades.","claimant":"Viral image","date":"2015-10-22","label":1,"related_articles":[27787,83800],"id":3305},{"claim":"Gov.

However, because he is Hispanic and can be used by the Clintons to push their narrative he is made out to be the victim. People need to wake up. Our country is being hijacked by radical progressives and socialists. The democrats, especially the demonic Clinton's, will completely transform the United States into a 3rd world country full of poverty, disease and perversion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Facebook, June 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-06-09","label":0,"related_articles":[8080,109551,111519,115379,116440,118379,122254,128614,133872,58883],"id":2984},{"claim":"Botswana condemned President Donald Trump's alleged remarks calling African nations \"shithole countries.\"","claimant":"","date":"2018-01-16","label":2,"related_articles":[116619,120795,136373,144271,153358,160138],"id":6015},{"claim":"Says Ohio Rep.

He walked around his soon to be church for 30 minutes while it was filling with people for service....only 3 people out of the 7-10,000 people said hello to him. He asked people for change to buy food... NO ONE in the church gave him change. He went into the sanctuary to sit down in the front of the church and was asked by the ushers if he would please sit in the back. He greeted people to be greeted back with stares and dirty looks, with people looking down on him and judging him.\n\nAs he sat in the back of the church, he listened to the church announcements and such. When all that was done, the elders went up and were excited to introduce the new pastor of the church to the congregation....\"We would like to introduce to you Pastor Jeremiah Steepek\"... The congregation looked around clapping with joy and anticipation.....The homeless man sitting in the back stood up... and started walking down the aisle... the clapping stopped with ALL eyes on him.... he walked up the altar and took the microphone from the elders (who were in on this) and paused for a moment.... then he recited\n\n\"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'\n\n\"The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'\"\n\nAfter he recited this, he looked towards the congregation and told them all what he had experienced that morning... many began to cry and many heads were bowed in shame... he then said... Today I see a gathering of people... not a church of Jesus Christ. The world has enough people, but not enough disciples... when will YOU decide to become disciples? He then dismissed service until next week... Being a Christian is more than something you claim. It's something you live by and share with others.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, July 2013","claimant":"","date":"2017-04-03","label":1,"related_articles":[108139,117232,128601],"id":6643},{"claim":" \"You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year.

During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers who represented the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths who explained their belief systems. I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say.\n\nThe Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam complete with a video. After the presentations time was provided for questions and answers. When it was my turn I directed my question to the Imam and asked: \"Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that all of the Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?\"\n\nThere was no disagreement with my statements and without hesitation he replied, \"Non-believers!\"\n\nI responded, \"So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven. Is that correct?\"\n\nThe expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nI then said, \"Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.\"\n\nThe Imam was speechless.\n\nI continued, \"I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question . . . would you rather have your Allah who tell[s] you to kill me in order to go to heaven or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to heaven and wants you to be with me?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.\n\nChuck Colson once told me something that has sustained me these 20 years of prison ministry.

But shopping at the big box megastore can be a bit overwhelming.  Did you know there is actually a \"Costco Price Tag Code\" that can let you know if you're getting the best deals?\n\nThe key to the code is not the dollars but the cents.  Those last two digits of the price tell you everything.  A price ending in .99 is much different than one ending in .97 or .49.  Check it out ...\n\nPrice ending in .99 \u2013 the product is full price\n\nAny time you see the price ending in .99 you know that item is full-priced and has not been marked down. It still may be a good deal though, this is Costco after all.\n\nPrice ending in .97 \u2013 a deal decided by the manager\n\nA price that ends in .97 is what we are looking for. Usually this is a special price you're not going to find again. Once it's gone it's gone. These can be some great deals.\n\nPrice ending in .49 or .79 \u2013 manufacturer's special\n\nA price ending in .49 or .79 is a manufacturer's special. This is a product the manufacturer is testing out at Costco, usually at a lower price than Costco would sell the item at.\n\nPrice ending in .00 \u2014 the goods are about to go!\n\nA price ending in .00 is probably the best deal you will find in the store. It means the manager wants the item out. And once it's out, the product is gone for good.\n\nA price tag with an asterisk \u2014 it's discounted and done\n\nBe on the lookout for price tags with an asterisk.

Apparently he feels that if his agenda is not met, then the state has a better chance of raising your child then you do!\n\nHere is the overview of the proposed bill\u2026. But please read carefully as this bill has very loosely defined terms as to what is a \u201cright\u201d and what could easily be manipulated to make a case for confiscating your child!\n\nLEGISLATIVE COUNSEL\u2019S DIGEST\n\nSB 18, as introduced, Pan. Bill of Rights for Children and Youth in California.\nExisting law provides for the care and welfare of children and youth in various contexts, including, but not limited to, child welfare services, foster care, health care, nutrition, homeless assistance, and education.\nAssembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009) declares the Legislature\u2019s support of a Bill of Rights for the Children and Youth of California that resolves to invest in all children and youth in order to achieve specified goals to create an optimal environment for their healthy development.\nThis bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California\u2019s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.\nThe bill would declare the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n\nBILL TEXT\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\nSECTION 1.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that all children and youth, regardless of gender, class, race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, religion, immigration status, sexual orientation, or ability, have inherent rights that entitle them to protection, special care, and assistance, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The right to parents, guardians, or caregivers who act in their best interest.\n(2) The right to form healthy attachments with adults responsible for their care and well-being.\n(3) The right to live in a safe and healthy environment.\n(4) The right to social and emotional well-being.\n(5) The right to opportunities to attain optimal cognitive, physical, and social development.\n(6) The right to appropriate, quality education and life skills leading to self-sufficiency in adulthood.\n(7) The right to appropriate, quality health care.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California created by Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009), to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California\u2019s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.\n\nSEC. 2.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact appropriate legislation to accomplish all of the following:\n\n(a) Develop and put forth research-based policy solutions that will ensure the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n(b) Determine the amount of revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n(c) Identify and obtain the revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n\nMany across the state are already calling this the \u201cThe Destruction of Family Act, or The Medical Kidnap Act, or The Government Owns Your Children Act.\u201d\nThe website, Age of Autism, asks, \u201cWhy would a state, in the United States of America, have to enact legislation to ensure what the Constitution already protects \u2013 life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?\u201d\nRead this closely again. Who decides what \u201cacting in a child\u2019s best interest\u201d means? Or what is \u201cappropriate\u201d healthcare?\nThis is very frightening and downright scary news to any parent in the state of California. Imagine for a minute that someone shows up at your door and physically takes your children out of your home? And for what reason? They didn\u2019t go to the dentist? They didn\u2019t get their latest flu shot? Perhaps you homeschool your child and the state doesn\u2019t think you are doing a good job.\nMany parents across social media are already calling this the \u2018most destructive\u2019 family based bill to ever hit the floor of the California senate. Some parents are even calling for immediate removal of Senator Pan from his senate seat.\nOne parent comments, \u201cThe lines of the California state senate and the endorsement deals that Senator Pan has made with various pharmaceutical companies are completely blurred. \u201c\n\nOne could say that this senator has been \u2018bought\u2019 and is nothing more than a \u2018whipping boy\u2019 for whatever drug company that decides to write him a check to endorse their latest products.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this may actually be the truth. According to Health Impact News,\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies and their trade groups gave more than $2 million to current members of the Legislature in 2013-2014, about 2 percent of the total raised, records show. Nine of the top 20 recipients are either legislative leaders or serve on either the Assembly or Senate health committees. Receiving more than $95,000, the top recipient of industry campaign cash is Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and doctor who is carrying the vaccine bill.\n\nIn addition, the industry donated more than $500,000 to outside campaign spending groups that helped elect some current members last year.\n\nPharmaceutical companies also spent nearly $3 million more during the 2013-2014 legislative session lobbying the Legislature, the governor, the state pharmacists\u2019 board and other agencies, according to state filings. (Source.)\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about this? Are you concerned that if this bill should pass that you would lose your rights to your child? That this bill would in essence be an infringement on your rights as a parent to your child?\n\nAnswer in the comments below\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, December 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-12-15","label":0,"related_articles":[109597,124485,124829,133958],"id":16477},{"claim":"Says that unless the recipient called back about \"your tax filings,\" you \"will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name.\"","claimant":"Anonymous Caller","date":"2018-04-10","label":0,"related_articles":[56235,16517,16523,55382],"id":15417},{"claim":"Says the percentage of officers the Chicago Police Board fired after hearing their cases or who chose to resign prior to a board hearing roughly doubled during her tenure.","claimant":"Lori Lightfoot","date":"2019-03-05","label":1,"related_articles":[32164,14407,32133],"id":1978},{"claim":"Says Hillary Clinton \"doesn\u2019t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.\"","claimant":"National Rifle Association","date":"2016-08-10","label":0,"related_articles":[42899,43187,6028,85570,59792,41061,1258,2354],"id":5531},{"claim":"A photograph shows the mouth of an adult suffering from hyperdontia.","claimant":"","date":"2019-02-04","label":0,"related_articles":[124730,150044],"id":1728},{"claim":" \"By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment.\" ","claimant":"Donald Trump","date":"2018-07-09","label":0,"related_articles":[43961,38196,43963,43970],"id":3020},{"claim":" Iran \"has committed multiple violations\" of the nuclear deal, specifically on heavy water limits, military inspections and advanced centrifuges.

Pershing effectively discouraged Muslim terrorists in the Philippines by killing them and burying their bodies along with those of pigs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHOW TO STOP ISLAMIC TERRORISTS . . . it worked once in our History . . .\n\nOnce in US history an episode of Islamic terrorism was very quickly stopped. It happened in the Philippines about 1911, when Gen. John J. Pershing was in command of the garrison. There had been numerous Islamic terrorist attacks, so \"Black Jack\" told his boys to catch the perps and teach them a lesson.\n\nForced to dig their own graves, the terrorists were all tied to posts, execution style. The US soldiers then brought in pigs and slaughtered them, rubbing their bullets in the blood and fat. Thus, the terrorists were terrorized; they saw that they would be contaminated with hogs' blood. This would mean that they could not enter Heaven, even if they died as terrorist martyrs.\n\nAll but one was shot, their bodies dumped into the grave, and the hog guts dumped atop the bodies. The lone survivor was allowed to escape back to the terrorist camp and tell his brethren what happened to the others. This brought a stop to terrorism in the Philippines for the next 50 years.\n\nPointing a gun into the face of Islamic terrorists won't make them flinch. They welcome the chance to die for Allah. Like Gen. Pershing, we must show them that they won't get to Muslim heaven (which they believe has an endless supply of virgins) but instead will die with the hated pigs of the\ndevil.\n\n\n\nSubject: How to end the war quickly if you have absolutely no respect for pigs!\n\nAn Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig. Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell. I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.\n\nIf we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell.

Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus.\n\nSome two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribble in childish handwriting which read, \"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday school.\"\n\nFor two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do.\n\nCarrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building. But the story does not end there!\n\nA newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 cent payment.\n\nChurch members made large subscriptions. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00 \u2014 a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid large dividends.\n\nWhen you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300, and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside at Sunday school time.\n\nIn one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history.

Selma Got Me Born - LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 - Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965.\n\n2.) Father Was A Goat Herder - LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government.\n\n3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter - L IAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had.\n\n4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom - LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya. It is the first widespread violence in decades.\n\n5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian - LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. According to the New York Times: \"I am a strong believer of the Islamic faith,\" Ms. Obama, 85, said in a recent interview in Kenya.' Not to mention, Christianity wouldn't allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man.\n\n6.) My Name is African Swahili - LIAR, your name is Arabic and 'Baraka' (from which Barack came) means 'blessed' in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama.\n\n7.)

Because I Lived In Indonesia, I Have More Foreign Experience - LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn't even speak the language.

I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs - LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies. You seek to disarm America while our avowed enemy, Iran, will not subject itself to a nuclear ban. Top Hamas politica l adviser Ahmed Yousef said the Hamas terrorist group 'supports Obama's foreign policy vision'.\n\n12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion - LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify - your classmates said you were just fine.\n\n13.)

I Wrote A Tough Nuclear Bill - LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation - mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came.\n\n23.) I Have Released My State Records - LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within.\n\n24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess - LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens. You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books.\n\n25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America - LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill.\n\n26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois - LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part.\n\n27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year - LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office.\n\n28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA - LIAR, the Candian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them.\n\n29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism - LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel. You state you will open friendly communication with the Leader of Iran who is attempting to develop nuclear weapons to destroy us, but refuse to speak to FOX news. You are against provisions of the Patriot act which would all wiretapping of the phones of suspected terrorists in the USA.\n\n30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet - LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially.\n\n31.) I Didn't Run Ads In Florida - LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks - and you still lost.\n\n32.) I Won Michigan - LIAR, no you didn't.\n\n33.) I won Nevada - LIAR, no you did not.\n\n34.) I Want All Votes To Count - LIAR, you said let the delegates decide.\n\n35.)

My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace - LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients.\n\n43.) I Inspire People With My Words - LIAR, you inspire people with other people's words.\n\n44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate - LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate - for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities.\n\n45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq - LIAR, you weren't in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date - AGAIN.\n\n46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care - LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay the 15,000,000 who don't have to buy it.\n\n47.) I Only Found Out About My Investment Conflicts Via Mail - LIAR, both companies you site as having sent you letters about this conflict have no record of any such letter ever being created or sent.\n\n48.) I Am As Patriotic As Anyone - LIAR, you won't wear a flag pin and you don't put your hand over your heart during the Anthem. There is a Cuban Flag with Che Guevara Displayed at Barack Obama Campaign Office which you allow to be displayed. You voted against making english the official language of the United States. You voted to give illegal aliens social security benefits, which would bankrupt the social security system for Americans legally paying into it.\n\n49.) My Wife Didn't Mean What She Said About Pride In Country - LIAR, your wife's words follow lock-step in the vain of Rev. Wright and Louis Farrahkan, in relation to their contempt and hatred of America.\n\n50.) Wal-Mart Is A Company I Wouldn't Support - LIAR, your wife has received nearly a quarter of a million dollars through Treehouse, which is connected to Wal-Mart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Email, May 2008","claimant":"","date":"2017-02-27","label":1,"related_articles":[103783,106856,115283,118215,120854,128578],"id":11779},{"claim":"Says four-year terms for City Council members are \"the norm in most cities of our size.\"","claimant":"Lee Leffingwell","date":"2011-02-25","label":2,"related_articles":[72319,69856],"id":4292},{"claim":"In the lame-duck session, \"no power was taken away from the governor.

The LA County Registrar alone, released this statement 10 minutes ago: \"First estimate of ballots remaining to be processed: ~240,063 provisional; 125,280 VMB returned at polls; 204,946 VBM recorded via mail.\"\n\nSan Diego County's website states, \"there are APPROXIMATELY 285000 Mail \/ Provisional ballots still to be counted,\" and San Bernardino County has 95,000 more outstanding.\n\nIn other words, there are 570,000 ballots to be counted in LA County, 285,000 in San Diego County, 95,000 in San Bernardino County (that's a total of 950,000 in just three counties), and who knows how many more need to be counted in California's 55 other counties (58 total).\n\nAt this point it's very likely we won't even see the provisional\/VMB ballot breakdown this week, or even the next.\n\nSources:\nhttps:\/\/www.lavote.net\/Documents\/News_Releases\/06072016_outstanding-ballots.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.sdvote.com\/content\/rov\/electioninfo\/election.xml\nhttps:\/\/www.sbcountyelections.com\/Elections\/2016\/0607\/ResultSchedule.aspx\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/LACountyRRCC\/status\/740641362979098624\n\n\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, Facebook, and Reddit, June 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-07-07","label":1,"related_articles":[106049,68964,119210,120799,120800,125116,126508],"id":6365},{"claim":"The Department of Energy spent $737 million on SolarReserve to create 45 jobs and benefit Ron Pelosi.","claimant":"","date":"2012-02-14","label":1,"related_articles":[108195,123881],"id":2294},{"claim":"The city of Sacramento is paying gang members $1.5 million to stop killing.","claimant":"","date":"2017-09-07","label":1,"related_articles":[104724,105651,105906,106268,124478],"id":9607},{"claim":"\"One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not\" 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.","claimant":"Rush Limbaugh","date":"2013-06-06","label":1,"related_articles":[90418,90417,94518,86342,86451,85043],"id":16720},{"claim":" California State Assembly passed a bill that would ban the sale of the Bible.

Fourteen days ago President Obama issued an Executive Order that you should know about.  This order gives an unprecedented level of authority to the President and the federal government to take over all the fundamental parts of our economy - in the name of national security - in times of national emergency. This means all of our water resources, construction services and materials (steel, concrete, etc.), our civil transportation system, food and health resources, our energy supplies including oil and natural gas \u2014 even farm equipment \u2014 can be taken over by the President and his cabinet secretaries. The Government can also draft U.S. citizens into the military and force U.S. citizens to fulfill \"labor requirements\" for the purposes of \"national defense.\" There is not even any Congressional oversight, only briefings are required.\n\nBy issuing this as an Executive Order the President puts the federal government above the law, which, in a democracy, is never supposed to happen.\n\nAs President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, he has the Constitutional authority to issue executive orders.  And while similar orders have been made before by presidents from Eisenhower and Reagan to Clinton and George Bush - it has never been done to this extent.\n\nIt is still unclear why this order was signed now, and what the consequences are for our nation - especially during times of peace.  This type of Martial Law imposes a government takeover on U.S. citizens that is typically reserved for national emergencies, not in a time of relative peace.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, March 2012","claimant":"","date":"2016-07-13","label":0,"related_articles":[108886,123253,129206,142438],"id":11426},{"claim":"\"We currently have the lowest inflation in the entire period of the existence of a market economy in Russia -- that is, in 25 years.\"","claimant":"Dmitry Medvedev","date":"2016-10-18","label":0,"related_articles":[159847,124187],"id":7094},{"claim":"Images show the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team\u2019s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.","claimant":"New York Times","date":"2017-04-19","label":1,"related_articles":[87494,78096,88956,72773,47154,29601,6174,58560,87492],"id":8335},{"claim":"A photograph shows Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing an antifa t-shirt.","claimant":"","date":"2018-02-16","label":0,"related_articles":[137031,145574,153364,154265],"id":15902},{"claim":"A woman who entered an Uber in Tampa, Florida, on 18\u00a0February 2019 was the victim of an attempted kidnapping by a \"sex traffic worker.\"","claimant":"","date":"2019-02-20","label":0,"related_articles":[153572,153627,153637,153868,154153],"id":6117},{"claim":"Says Sen.

Love you all\nPS. one woman left for work to Valley Children's Hospital & that's the last time she was seen.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, June 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-10-23","label":1,"related_articles":[103728,118748,118749,128356,128787,128788,129624],"id":12937},{"claim":"Clinton was \"laughing at the girl who was raped.\u201d","claimant":"Donald Trump","date":"2016-10-09","label":0,"related_articles":[58874,70479,11368,94000,6031,58971,58855,95769,58875,58903,58877,88942,58736,58803,58974,58922,58780,55872,3719],"id":3546},{"claim":"Says Dr. Robert Gallo, the man who helped discover the HIV virus, confessed he was \"forced\" to \"create the HIV virus as a secret weapon to wipe out the African race.\"","claimant":"Facebook posts","date":"2019-02-14","label":0,"related_articles":[80085,12373],"id":6011},{"claim":"Says that Dianne Feinstein said that \"all vets are mentally ill in some way and government should prevent them from owning firearms.\"","claimant":"Bloggers","date":"2018-09-24","label":0,"related_articles":[54522,37794],"id":16460},{"claim":"Obama \"refused to not only put his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance, but refused to say the pledge.\"","claimant":"Chain email","date":"2007-11-08","label":0,"related_articles":[2178,11902,560,2564,126394],"id":4362},{"claim":"\u201cThe average tax increase on families nationwide earning up to $86,100 would be $794.00\u201d","claimant":"Bob Casey","date":"2017-10-24","label":0,"related_articles":[93571,35204],"id":14945},{"claim":"A photograph captures Donald Trump hanging out with musician Tupac Shakur.","claimant":"","date":"2018-10-01","label":0,"related_articles":[132809,148333],"id":9359},{"claim":"Says state Senate leaders have accepted $142,400 in campaign contributions from dentists and pharmacists during the past two years.","claimant":"Renee Unterman","date":"2013-03-26","label":1,"related_articles":[78937,8887],"id":454},{"claim":"Says Donald\u00a0Trump \"proposes tax cuts, too -- $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his.\"","claimant":"Sherrod Brown","date":"2016-07-28","label":1,"related_articles":[66632,88753],"id":6056},{"claim":"People traveling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program could be turned away due to new requirements involving biometric passports, or ePassports.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI saw this on a FB post of one of my friends. It does no sound right. Could you find out. Thank you in advance.\n\nThis needs passing around far and wide and will affect anyone in the UK who doesn't have a biometric passport (also known as an e-passport) if flying to the USA.\n\nI was supposed to be on a flight this morning travelling to Florida for a holiday with my family booked through Thomson's, we saved long and hard for this holiday and filled in all the neccessary online forms including API and ESTA's only a couple of weeks ago only to turn up at the check in desk to be advised that I would not be allowed to travel as I did not have a biometric passport whilst the rest of our family had them, despite calls to the USA from the lady on check in they would not permit travel.\n\nThis is a change that came into force from USA Homeland Security on the 1st April 2016 which nobody including Thomson's seemed to be aware of until they were confronted with it on the day it came into force. Yet a month on Thomson's are still not advising people who have booked with them of the change and on calling their ''Customer Services'' if you can call it that they are just placing the onus back on the passenger citing ''it is the travellers responsibility to check everything is valid for travel''\n\nDo a Google search, it isn't mentioned on the Gov website, it isn't mentioned on Thomson's website either.\n\nMy passport was in date and had more than 6 months on it and I had filled out the ESTA's which were all approved.\n\nWe were then advised that if we still wished to travel on another date that we would have to pay an extra \u00a3150 each to transfer the booking. with no alternative I advised the rest of our party to go without me and I would try and see what I could do and look to meet up with them at the earliest available date which looks like being Wednesday next week from a different airport.\n\nI have now spent best part of 3 hours on the phone being passed from pillar to post and had to fork out over \u00a3500 to try and get to the US on Wednesday to meet up with a very distraught family to try and rescue a totally ruined holiday.\n\nHas anyone else suffered the same issue? What if any legal redress do we have?\n\nSo just to be clear, if you are travelling to the USA you won't be allowed to travel if you have a non biometric passport. The Biometric Passport has a camera logo on the front cover in the centre at the bottom of the page for those who may be unaware of the difference and were introduced gradually from 2006 onwards\n\nI am telling the world and his dog to raise awareness as it is clear that Thomson don't give two monkeys about customer care.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, May 2016","claimant":"","date":"2019-02-21","label":1,"related_articles":[112955,116657,120033,128025,128026],"id":3786},{"claim":"\"The murder rate in our country is the highest it\u2019s been in 47 years.\"","claimant":"Donald Trump","date":"2017-02-07","label":0,"related_articles":[62809,38805],"id":6886},{"claim":"My \"border security efforts have led to a 60 percent  decrease in border crime.\"","claimant":"Rick Perry","date":"2010-03-10","label":0,"related_articles":[6480,6453],"id":11284},{"claim":"\"Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin\u2019s dumpster.\"","claimant":"Bloggers","date":"2018-07-12","label":0,"related_articles":[20062,21045,12290,44385,75211,78078,21679],"id":1971},{"claim":"A photograph shows an elephant carrying a lion cub.","claimant":"","date":"2019-02-05","label":0,"related_articles":[154405,162934],"id":1822},{"claim":"\"More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings.\"","claimant":"Michael Medved","date":"2014-08-19","label":1,"related_articles":[83523,87993],"id":1308},{"claim":"\"Every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing.\"","claimant":"Greg Gutfeld","date":"2017-06-02","label":0,"related_articles":[66874,73799,94122,91401,56866],"id":9112},{"claim":"\"Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, commits bank and tax fraud and gets 47 months.

So I strongly suspect that Chuck Schumer\u2019s political operation knew about Ms. Ford\u2019s allegations as far back as July and manipulated the process all along to include taking advantage of Ms. Ford\u2019s confidences.\u201d","claimant":"Tom Cotton","date":"2018-10-09","label":0,"related_articles":[79931,58264,60946,23255,47508,39078,44959,23138,60784],"id":9484},{"claim":"Two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks \"are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions.\"","claimant":"Scott Walker","date":"2013-02-13","label":1,"related_articles":[85412,4899],"id":3296},{"claim":"\"I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream.\"","claimant":"Barack Obama","date":"2008-02-26","label":2,"related_articles":[1947,115283,11523],"id":4898},{"claim":"\"Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers.\"","claimant":"Dan Patrick","date":"2017-07-13","label":1,"related_articles":[15841,22223,15271,15557,93422],"id":16994},{"claim":"A photograph shows a donut with \"Muslim writing\" on it.","claimant":"","date":"2016-12-06","label":0,"related_articles":[109673,109964],"id":4886},{"claim":" The National Science Foundation \"provides financial support to more than twice as many graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences as in computer science, mathematics or material science.\" ","claimant":"Rep.

He was being drilled by some senator I didn't recognize who asked him:\n\n'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?'\n\nOliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'\n\nThe senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't this just a little excessive?'\n\n'No sir,' continued Oliver.\n\n'No. And why not?'\n\n'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'\n\n'Threatened? By who.'\n\n'By a terrorist, sir.'\n\n'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'\n\n'His name is Osama bin Laden.'\n\nAt this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.\n\n'Why are you so afraid of this man?'\n\n'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'\n\n'And what do you recommend we do about him?'\n\n'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.'\n\nThe senator disagreed with this approach and that was all they showed of the clip.\n\nIt's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like the virus they truly are.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, November 2001","claimant":"","date":"2017-11-06","label":0,"related_articles":[109659,113069,113086],"id":12869},{"claim":"\"You've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.\"","claimant":"Hillary Clinton","date":"2016-09-12","label":1,"related_articles":[72735,88495,18877],"id":5944},{"claim":"Artist Lana Newstrom is creating invisible art and selling it for millions of dollars.","claimant":"","date":"2017-11-06","label":0,"related_articles":[109034,115736],"id":543},{"claim":"\u201cWe have increased by 42 percent the approval for veterans using the Choice program.\u201d","claimant":"Donald Trump","date":"2017-04-29","label":1,"related_articles":[62840,60880,71551,43356],"id":14100},{"claim":"\u201cOur incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran.\"","claimant":"Donald Trump","date":"2016-08-03","label":0,"related_articles":[58727,91987,62759,63079,80521,41040,69963,85689],"id":8404},{"claim":"\"Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago.\"","claimant":"Scott Walker","date":"2013-06-02","label":1,"related_articles":[80849,91387,66622],"id":14034},{"claim":" Federal taxpayers are \u201csubsidizing\u201d Amazon\u2019s Postal Service deliveries.

Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking.\n\nThe news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama's legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administrations efforts to move the country in a new direction.\n\nBritain's Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, Obama Eligibility Questioned, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama's first official visit to the U.K.\n\nIn a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama's dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrios case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president.\n\nGary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, April 2009","claimant":"","date":"2016-08-14","label":0,"related_articles":[104003,104004,113420,113957,118532],"id":3151},{"claim":"Over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol is contaminated with the Machupo virus and should be avoided.","claimant":"","date":"2018-01-02","label":0,"related_articles":[124715,142963],"id":14678},{"claim":"Says that Mitt Romney, while he was in Arizona, said he believes the state\u2019s SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws.","claimant":"Charlie Gonzalez","date":"2012-03-27","label":0,"related_articles":[1144,95167,71018,71005,83688,96076,70030],"id":1104},{"claim":"Eating alligator in New Orleans will help save the wetlands of Louisiana.","claimant":"","date":"2018-01-24","label":0,"related_articles":[105845,120308,134890,135913],"id":11550},{"claim":"\"McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV\/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators.\"","claimant":"Democratic National Committee","date":"2008-04-28","label":1,"related_articles":[91001,91009,91012],"id":12301},{"claim":"A photograph shows Bernie Sanders at a 1962 civil rights sit-in.","claimant":"","date":"2019-02-25","label":2,"related_articles":[67798,116467,116468,123503,126561,132823,28511,161340,161341],"id":16927},{"claim":"\"Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world.\"","claimant":"John McCain","date":"2010-06-27","label":0,"related_articles":[84174,181,70086,81947,82070,71012,94965,75319,92253,68942,92103],"id":2296},{"claim":"A video shows three sharks in an area of Miami, Florida that was flooded by Hurricane Irma.","claimant":"","date":"2017-09-12","label":0,"related_articles":[110773,112469,125724,126266,131173,131602,131828],"id":11868},{"claim":"Some 700-plus undocumented migrants, including sex offenders, were apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol overnight.","claimant":"","date":"2019-03-22","label":1,"related_articles":[130994,143525,144240,151174],"id":2070},{"claim":"A list of 'Which Side of the Fence?' entries distinguishing Republicans from Democrats originated with comedian Jeff Foxworthy.","claimant":"","date":"2018-04-02","label":0,"related_articles":[119690,120313],"id":1296},{"claim":"Says \"he fought Obama at the Supreme Court \u2014 and won.\"","claimant":"Josh Hawley","date":"2016-06-14","label":1,"related_articles":[11378,87775],"id":14623},{"claim":"Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta has been admitted to Nairobi Hospital for an eye ailment","claimant":"Afrikan Daily","date":"2019-01-09","label":0,"related_articles":[129964,130015,130014],"id":12040},{"claim":"Pacific Palisades High School placed an unusual message on their school telephone answering system.","claimant":"","date":"2016-10-23","label":0,"related_articles":[113165,113210],"id":14556},{"claim":"\"It\u2019s clear\" that\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0\"violated national security laws.\"","claimant":"Jack Graham","date":"2016-04-05","label":0,"related_articles":[60883,61202,18651],"id":690},{"claim":"\"18 million illegal immigrants got their government checks this month\" while federal workers remain unpaid.","claimant":"Facebook posts","date":"2019-01-21","label":0,"related_articles":[50986,50927,39892,14542,87855,45052,30356],"id":6783},{"claim":"\"You know, the border\u2019s down 78 percent.

As part of the Oslo agreement Israel had to agree to release so called \"political prisoners\". However, Israeli officials insisted that they would not release any with \"blood on their hands\".

As I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections.\n\nBill says: \"In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\" \n\nThe facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.\" \n\nThe facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.\" \n\nThe facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam; yes, flunked. It is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas \u2014 none \u2014 and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas\nGovernor.\n\nBill says: \"President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman.\" \n\nThe facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.\n\nBill says: \"She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.\" \n\nThe facts are: Yes, she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Walmart board of directors for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994, but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.\"\n\nThe facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary was the face of America all over the world.\"\n\nThe facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.\"\n\nThe facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.\n\nHere is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton:\n\nShe has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country\n(that's you and me!) when it comes to the war on terror.\n\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to\/from the USA.\n\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.\n\n4.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.\n\n5.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.\n\nOne cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our country and make it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.\n\nShare this with every democrat you know. Ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it \u2014 Dick Morris has said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for defamation of character! And you better believe Hillary would sue him.\n\nIs America ready for a woman president?\n\nI believe we are, just NOT THIS one.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, January 2016","claimant":"","date":"2016-07-05","label":1,"related_articles":[112217,117298,77190,119616,123823,126341,126348,133104,144960,152304,161826],"id":13625},{"claim":"Says CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper stood in a ditch during Hurricane Florence to exaggerate water levels.","claimant":"Viral image","date":"2018-09-16","label":0,"related_articles":[33307,70445,59648],"id":16600},{"claim":"\"Bill White has a long history of trying to limit or even disenfranchise military voters.\"","claimant":"Republican Party of Texas","date":"2010-06-04","label":1,"related_articles":[90142,12083,90139,71441,93896,68070,1263],"id":14881},{"claim":"Ken Cuccinelli \"tried to shut down\" state government.","claimant":"Terry McAuliffe","date":"2013-09-25","label":0,"related_articles":[6632,5518,1521],"id":8504},{"claim":"\"We are seeing kids who are healthier.\"","claimant":"Hillary Clinton","date":"2016-10-27","label":1,"related_articles":[95483,86397],"id":2184},{"claim":"Martin Luther King Jr. \"was a Republican.\"","claimant":"Philip Van Cleave","date":"2016-01-18","label":0,"related_articles":[7149,125818,2003],"id":9478},{"claim":"Under the House Republican tax proposal, \"the average family of four earning median income ($59,000\/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year.\"","claimant":"Drew Ferguson","date":"2017-11-05","label":1,"related_articles":[20246,57314],"id":4204},{"claim":"\"I\u2019ve never supported legislation that invades people\u2019s choices about contraception.\"","claimant":"Ken Cuccinelli","date":"2013-08-27","label":1,"related_articles":[82684,70118,8294,95878,4495,2929,82616,71259,79729,78170],"id":7860},{"claim":"Apple is eliminating the headphone jack for iPhone 7 in order to force users to purchase expensive Bluetooth equipment or proprietary headphones.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeople posting in FB rumor that iPhone 7 will have new ear phone jacks to render old ones useless and buy new ones.

It is now the law of the land that by March 23rd 2013 we will all be required to have an RFID chip underneath our skin and this chip will be link to our bank accounts as well as have our personal records and tracking capability built into it...\"\n\n\n\nSeems people will be getting more than they bargained for in this new health care bill.\n\nThe Obama health care bill under Sec. 2521, page 1,000 will establish a National Medical Device Registry. What does a National Medical Device Registry mean?\n\nNational Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1,001-1,008:\n(g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the 'registry') to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that:\n\n(A) is or has been used in or on a patient;\n(B) and is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (i) a class III device;\n\n\u00a0 &nbsp or (ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.\nA \"class II device that is implantable?\"\n\nThen on page 1,004 it describes what the term \"data\" means in paragraph 1, section B: \"(B) In this paragraph, the term 'data' refers to in formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1), including claims data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\"\n\nApproved by the FDA, a class II implantable device is a \"implantable radiofrequency transponder system for patient identification and health information.\"\n\nThis sort of device would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option. With the reform of the private insurance companies, who charge outrageous rates, many people will switch their coverage to a more affordable insurance plan. This means the number of people who choose the public option will increase. This also means the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. The adults who choose to have a chip implanted are the lucky (yes, lucky if you're a Govt Control Libtard) ones in this case. Children who are \"born in the United States who at the time of birth is not otherwise covered under acceptable coverage\" will be qualified and placed into the CHIP or Children's Health Insurance Program (what a convenient name). With a name like CHIP it would seem consistent to have the chip implanted into a child.
