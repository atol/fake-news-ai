There is no treatment and no vaccine. It has jumped species, (by feeding greyhounds raw horse meat, which was infected with horse influenza), (horse influenza is avian flu, which jumped species from birds (avian flu), to horses (horse influenza). The avian flu has now moved to racing greyhounds and domestic dogs and the indications are that there may be a potential problem for humans. It is deadly and it is on the loose. It may just be a matter of time. The CDC is watching the disease.\n\nThere is no central tracking agency with report and stat capability for dogs that will get the word out to all vets in the US.\n\n\nThe domestic dog population is at present risk.\n\nThis week on my net groups I saw many anecdotal accounts of $100,000 show dogs dying while packed in ice and hooked up to IVs, with high temps. No one knows what is wrong with these dogs and the vets do not know what they are treating. I think it is Greyhound Influenza or Race Flu.\n\nShow populations are now infected and the majority of veterinarians have never heard of the disease. Isolated individuals know this but the country as a whole does not. A few days after exposure at dog shows, dogs are traveling back to their home states and infecting the local populations. Many dogs are dying needlessly. It is not kennel cough.\n\nThe period of incubation is 2-5 days. It is airborne, can be transmitted by inanimate objects, and clothing. Virtually all exposed will contract. The morbidity is 80% with 20% being sub clinically affected and shedding the virus. The course of the disease is four weeks. There are two forms, milder and very extreme. Two weeks into the viral disease the dog looks like he is getting over the cough and then bacterial infections become an acute problem. Oft times the owner has reported the dog is well, only to find that a short time later an acute bacterial infection has taken over the dog, in a matter of hours. The owners think the disease has run its course only to learn it hasn't gotten started yet, so dogs are dying needlessly.\n\nMy vet thinks earlier rather than later treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are the best way to treat the disease. With proper vet care perhaps there will only be a mortality of 1-5%.\n\nThe information needs to go out so that all vets will know this is not kennel cough, so they will not VAX for kennel cough while ill, and so they can monitor beyond the two week period.\n\nIt has been almost impossible for me to understand how in the last four days i have contacted state vets who have never heard of the new influenza, all the while, the people with the info on the disease, refuse to release it nationally.\n\nThe AVMA has info that will go out next month. How many will die prior to that? I have begged and cajoled them to do this, so perhaps we are making some headway, however, we need info to go out ASAP.\n\nAPHIS says it is not their job.\n\nThe people who are handling research on the initial outbreak in FLA., are contacting local, (FLA) BUT not national sources to disseminate information.\n\nBelow is a link to a photo album in which i placed the FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory, which was put out by the FLA VET MED ASSOC., at the request of the State Vet. It is not on the state website.\n\nhttp:\/\/photobucket.com\/albums\/y249\/citycolumbus\/\n\nIn my conversations with the researchers at the U. of FLA. I was told, by the lead researcher, who owns greyhounds, that they have no responsibility to provide this info to other states or to other vets. (BTW, Is some of the research funded by the gaming organizations?) (My state, GA., the state of FLA., and three highly placed individuals at Pfizer, told me to call the researcher.) The researcher said to me that cultures do not need to be done on potential affecteds, and she denied that the illness is from horses, though she is quoted in articles as applauding the Cornell researcher who identified it as horse influenza. The FLA state vet said: \"We know it came from horses.\"\n\nThe researcher is working to do a contracted vaccine with \" a company.\" She is working on a paper. She did not want to discuss the influenza though her name, email and number appears as the contact source on the state of FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory that went out to all FLA vets. I was told by some at Pfizer that Pfizer is not the company who is helping her develop the vaccine.\n\nThe researcher said the FLA VETERINARY ALERT AND ADVISORY should not be put on the net. However the FLA state Vet, Dr. Thomas Holt, told me, on Fri., Sept 16, 2005 to put it on the net...\"Feel free to use it.\"\n\nMany state vets who do not know anything at all about this illness even though the state of FLA. put out memos on the influenza in August 05 in the state of FLA., without notifying other states.\n\nIf the researchers are correct there will be a national epidemic. When a disease is in a mobile population an epidemic is possible. Large groupings of dogs, such as shows, kennels, rescues, etc., are at risk.\n\nMost vets across the country have never heard of the disease. A treatment protocol has not been developed. They are treating it as if it is kennel cough. All vets need to be informed about it ASAP! Many of us concerned dog people would like to see state statistics compiled on the illness and the eventual treatment outcomes.\n\nFolks, this is one of the many new problems we are seeing from feeding raw meat to dogs. Please do not do it.\n\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Collected on the Internet, 2005","claimant":"","date":"2017-11-06","label":2,"related_articles":[103935,118583,123210,123448,129074,143621],"id":783},{"claim":"Iceland has virtually removed the occurrence of Down syndrome from their population through abortion.","claimant":"","date":"2017-08-17","label":1,"related_articles":[105919,110766,115780],"id":787},{"claim":"Says Governor-elect Scott Walker\u2019s choice as transition team leader \"killed the release of a damaging report on Walker\u2019s record in the days leading up to the election.\"","claimant":"Democratic Party of Wisconsin","date":"2010-11-05","label":1,"related_articles":[96198,69392],"id":802},{"claim":"Says Ron Johnson \"is benefiting from several super PACs, I am not.\"","claimant":"Russ  Feingold","date":"2016-10-27","label":0,"related_articles":[96186,1121,48267],"id":806},{"claim":"\"Big soda has a lot of money.\u00a0They make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that we\u2019re trying to cure.\"","claimant":"Jim Kenney","date":"2016-03-27","label":2,"related_articles":[11229,5867,88079],"id":809},{"claim":"A GoFundMe campaign raised millions of dollars for the construction of a border wall within a few days of its launch in December 2018.","claimant":"","date":"2018-12-20","label":2,"related_articles":[113635,134647,143473,144658,145253,151444,151869,152030,152773,53640,154399,161350,161917],"id":810},{"claim":"Says \"New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country.\"","claimant":"Sheila Oliver","date":"2012-02-27","label":1,"related_articles":[90153,79650],"id":820},{"claim":"Under President George W.

It is supposedly a repost from Evelyn Momplaisir, but her public page does not show the post. Can you verify this happened?\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere's a Twitter screengrab making the rounds. You've probably seen it - a Fairfax county mother named Evelyn Momplaisir who was shocked because her son is encountering racist remarks from school bullies. To wit: once President, Trump will kick your family out of the country.\n\nI hate to be put in the position of devil's advocate on this, but preliminary searches are unearthing a few suspicious details. And let's face it - even with the best of intentions, we have ALL been fooled by online stories before.\n\nCan anyone actually validate this?\n\nTwitter shows that Evelyn Momplaisir doesn't have an account. (True, it could have been deleted or made private for some reason.)\n\nThere's been no legitimate news coverage on this that I can find. Seems to me this is the kind of a story that the \"liberal media\" would KILL themselves to ferret out.\n\nThere is an Evelyn Momplaisir on Facebook. She is black and has a school-age son. But her occupation is a Fairfax County Public Schools TEACHER. In addition, Momplaisir received some nationwide attention 6 years ago when the Today show ran some sort of fluff piece on her wedding. (I have no idea how that would tie in here - it's just an unusual side note.)\n\nYou guys know me. I have nothing good to say about any part of Donald Trump. But I pride myself on fairness - I'm not going to take this potshot if it's not warranted. Lord knows there's enough legitimate stuff to say about the man without resorting to untrue viral crap.\n\nI hope I'm wrong. And at the same time, I hope I'm not.\n\nBut can anyone confirm anything about this story?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, March

Clinton\u2019s campaign \u201cthreatened\u201d to vote down every concession made to Bernie on the platform if he did not endorse her prior to the convention. Knowing that Superdelegates were not going to switch to his side without something major happening, the best he could do was hold on to the progressive concessions he won for US on the platform. He could not, in good consciousness let the GOP and Trump win, especially when we have a potential half of the Supreme Court Justices that will be replaced within the next 4-8 years. He was looking out for the future of our movement and our nation in this very hard decision he made. This post is not to tell you to vote for Hillary, or to not leave the Democratic Party, etc. this was just to throw a little light on why Bernie did what he felt he HAD to do, rather than what he wanted to do. A sign of a great leader is someone who makes the hard decision to sacrifice themselves for the people and movement behind him.

The nurse just kinda slipped it in along with all the other regular questions. I told her I refused to answer because it was against the law to ask. Everyone, whether you have guns or not, should give a neutral answer so they have no idea who does and who doesn't.\n\nMy doctor asked me if I had guns in my house and also if any were loaded. I , of course, answered yes to both questions. Then he asked why I kept a loaded gun close to my bed. I answered that my son, who is a certified gun instructor and also works for Homeland Security, advised me that an unloaded, locked up gun is no protection against criminal attack. The Government now requires these questions be asked of people on Medicare, and probably everyone else.\n\nJust passing this along for your information: I had to visit a doctor other than my regular doctor when my doctor was on vacation. One of the questions on the form I had to fill out was: Do you have any guns in your house?? My answer was None of your damn business!! So it is out there!\n\nIt is either an insurance issue or government intervention. Either way, it is out there and the second the government gets into your medical records (As they want to under Obamacare) it will become a major issue and will ultimately result in lock and load!!\n\nPlease pass this on to all the other retired guys and gun owners...Thanks.\n\n\n\nFrom a Vietnam Vet and retired Police Officer:\n\nI had a doctors appointment at the local VA clinic yesterday and found out something very interesting that I would like to pass along.\n\nWhile going through triage before seeing the doctor, I was asked at the end of the exam, three questions:\n\n1. Did I feel stressed? \n2. Did I feel threatened?  \n3. Did I feel like doing harm to someone?\n\nThe nurse then informed me, that if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security.\n\nLooks like they are going after the vets first. Other gun people like retired law enforcement will probably be next. Then when they go after the civilians, what argument will they have?\n\nBe forewarned and be aware. The Obama administration has gone on record as considering veterans and gun owners potential terrorists. Whether you are a gun owner veteran or not, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !\n\nIf you know veterans and gun owners, please pass this on to them.

Then suddenly, no one ever mentioned anything about those Israelis and later it became clear that they remarkably did not show up in their jobs the day the incident took place.\n\nNo one talked about any Israeli being killed or wounded in the attacks. Arab diplomatic sources revealed to the Jordanian al-Watan newspaper that those Israelis remained absent that day based on hints from the Israeli General Security apparatus, the Shabak, the fact which evoked unannounced suspicions on American officials who wanted to know how the Israeli government learned about the incident before it occurred, and the reasons why it refrained from informing the U.S authorities of the information it had.\n\nSuspicions had increased further after Israeli newspaper Yadiot Ahranot revealed that the Shabak prevented Israeli premier Ariel Sharon from traveling to New York and particularly to the city's eastern coast to participate in a festival organized by the Zionist organizations in support of the \"Israel\". Aharon Bernie, the commentator at the newspaper, brought up the issue and came up with a negative conclusion, saying \"no answer\". He then asked about the clue behind the Shabak's position in preventing Sharon's participation, and again without giving an answer.\n\nBernie added that Sharon, who was delighted for having his speech on top of the festival agenda, asked the head of the organization to mediate and convince the Shabak to change its position, but his attempts were in vain. The next day after Sharon's secretary officially announced that Sharon would not participate the incident took place.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper revealed that the FBI arrested five Israelis four hours after the attack on the Twin Towers while filming the smoking skyline from the roof of their company's building. The FBI had arrested the five for \"puzzling behavior\". They are said to have been caught videotaping the disaster in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery.\n\n\n\nIt has been confirmed by the US Goverment and FBI that at the time of the accident, there were 4000 Jews who MIRACULOUSLY never came to their work an the World trade Center building at the time of the accident. This means the Jews knew and were prewarned about the accident that the WTC was going to be hit.... WHY ??????\n\nIn every crime you look at who has most to benefit from the act. In this case this crime has been a disaster for America, for the world and also for Arabs and Musilms. The only people who benefited from this act of terror are the Jews. This is not the first time Israel and the Jews have done something like this in the name of someone else to further their own selfish needs. They have even resorted to kiling their own people to win public sympathy and support. This act is not beyond the capabilities and evil deeds of Israel. In this case it seems that it is clear to all that the Jews\/Israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act.\n\nI hope the FBI follows the smoking gun as no one will commit an act unless he has something to gain from it, Israel should be a prime suspect in this case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, September 2001","claimant":"","date":"2017-11-06","label":0,"related_articles":[113101,113331],"id":8933},{"claim":"A pedophilia group put up a sign reading \"Pedophiles are People Too\" near a school in Oregon.","claimant":"","date":"2018-08-01","label":1,"related_articles":[149984,153925,153943],"id":8953},{"claim":"\"Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008,\" showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal.","claimant":"Peter Schweizer","date":"2015-05-01","label":0,"related_articles":[33778,33797,94129,88663,85338],"id":8957},{"claim":"Editorial by Dr. Jack Wheeler describes Barack Obama as an \"eloquently tailored empty suit.\"","claimant":"","date":"2019-01-04","label":2,"related_articles":[128237,128238,129449],"id":8965},{"claim":"\"When Jeb (Bush) was governor, his first four years as governor, his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine.\"","claimant":"John Kasich","date":"2016-02-13","label":1,"related_articles":[60033,13293,7956],"id":8977},{"claim":"Donald Trump said he'd overturn the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision if elected president.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrump plans to reverse marriage equality if elected president\n\nAs Trump says he'll reverse gay marriage laws, here's where homosexuality is still illegal https:\/\/t.co\/BWvhAgLQij pic.twitter.com\/JjlQaHbT0v\n\u2014 i100 (@thei100) February 1, 2016\nThere is a post going around Facebook that Donald Trump will reverse gay marriage rights if he is elected president.

It is because his long legislative record shows that the actions that he took to protect his family, his own response to a dangerous life threatening situation, are actions that he feels ordinary citizens should not have if they were faced with an identical situation.\n\nIt has prompted some to ask if the Senator believes his life and personal safety is more valuable than yours or mine.\n\nBut, this is to be expected from those who believe they can run our lives, raise our kids, and protect our families better than we can.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, February 2011","claimant":"","date":"2016-06-26","label":0,"related_articles":[119214,122541],"id":11938},{"claim":"Says President John F.

It was a cowboy'\u0080\u0099s life, a gamblers life, a life for someone who wanted no boss, constant movement, and the thrill of a dice roll every time a new passenger got into the cab.\n\nWhat I didn't count on when I took the job was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift, the car became a rolling confessional. Passengers would climb in, sit behind me in total darkness and anonymity, and tell me of their lives. \n\nWe were like strangers on a train, the passengers and I, hurtling through the night, revealing intimacies we would never have dreamed of sharing during the brighter light of day.\n\nIn those hours, I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh, and made me weep.  And none of those lives touched me more than that of a woman I picked up late on a warm August night. I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partyers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover or someone going off to an early shift at some factory in the industrial part of town.\n\nWhen I arrived at the address, the building was dark except for a single light in a ground-floor window. Under these circumstances many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a short minute, and then drive away. Too many bad possibilities awaited a driver who went up to a darkened building at two-thirty in the morning.\n\nBut I had seen too many people trapped in a live of poverty who depended on the cab as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door to try to find the passenger. It might, I reasoned, be someone who needed my assistance. Would I not want a driver to do the same if my mother or father had called for a cab? \n\nSo I walked to the door and knocked.\n\n\"Just a minute\", answered a frail and elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. \n\nAfter a long pause, the door opened. A small woman, somewhere in her eighties, stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like you might see in a costume shop or a Goodwill store or in a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The sound had been her dragging it across the floor.\n\nThe apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.\n\n\"Would you carry my bag out to the car?\" she said. \"I'd like a few moments alone. Then, if you could come back and help me? I'm not very strong.\"\n\nI took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm, and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. \n\n\"It's nothing\", I told her. \"I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated\". \n\n\"Oh, you're such a good boy\", she said. Her praise and appreciation were almost embarrassing.\n\nWhen we got in the cab, she gave me an address, and then asked, \"Could you drive through downtown?\"\n\n\"It's not the shortest way,\" I answered. \n\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" she said. \"I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice\".\n\nI looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. \n\n\"I don't have any family left,\" she continued. \"The doctor said I should go there. He says I don't have very long.\" \n\nI quietly reached over and shut off the meter. \"What route would you like me to go?\" I asked.\n\nFor the next two hours we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they had first been married. She made me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she would have me slow down in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.\n\nAs the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, \"I'm tired. Let's go now.\"\n\nWe drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a tar driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. Without waiting for me, they opened the door and began assisting the woman. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her: perhaps she had phone them right before we left.\n\nI opened the trunk and took the small suitcase up to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. \n\n\"How much do I owe you?\" she asked, reaching into her purse. \n\n\"Nothing,\" I said.\n\n\"You have to make a living,\" she answered. \n\n\"There are other passengers,\" I responded. \n\nAlmost without thinking, I bent over and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. \"You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" \n\nThere was nothing more to say. I squeezed her hand once, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me I could hear the door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.\n\nI did not pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the remainder of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten a driver who had been angry or abusive or impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run or had honked once, then driven away? What if I had been in a foul mood and had refused to engage the woman in conversation? How many other moments like that had I missed or failed to grasp?\n\nWe are so conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unawares. When that woman hugged me and said that I had brought her a moment of joy, it was possible to believe  that I had been placed on earth for the sole purpose of providing her with that last ride. I do not think that I have done anything in my life that was any more important. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, January 2012","claimant":"","date":"2016-03-27","label":0,"related_articles":[109381,109382],"id":11959},{"claim":"Says he \"often\" appeared on The O\u2019Reilly Factor\u00a0and \"often was praised\" by\u00a0Bill\u00a0O'Reilly.","claimant":"David Corn","date":"2015-02-25","label":1,"related_articles":[83878,77816,9048,83879],"id":11974},{"claim":"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison.\"","claimant":"Drug Policy Alliance","date":"2015-02-19","label":1,"related_articles":[95436,88638,88646,88639,92752,92477,9337,86323,67991,90659,87641,91670],"id":11979},{"claim":"In the United States, \"we tax our exports and don't tax our imports.\"","claimant":"Paul Ryan","date":"2017-01-25","label":1,"related_articles":[88935,14379,9203,21666,5740],"id":11980},{"claim":"Says Tammy Baldwin \"wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!\"","claimant":"Restore American Freedom and Liberty","date":"2017-02-16","label":0,"related_articles":[81245,34012,34014],"id":11982},{"claim":"The American Civil Liberties Union issued a response to President Trump's 2018 State of the Union address complaining that he used the word \"America\" more than 80 times.","claimant":"","date":"2018-02-28","label":0,"related_articles":[143179,144724],"id":11983},{"claim":" \u201cTRUMP SENDS IN THE FEDS \u2013 Sanctuary City Leaders Arrested\" ","claimant":"Various websites","date":"2018-05-17","label":0,"related_articles":[62100,26955,26957,47895],"id":11984},{"claim":"\"How many federal rulings have NOW found intentional discrimination by #Txlege since 2011? 6.\"","claimant":"Rafael Anchia","date":"2017-04-20","label":2,"related_articles":[60890,55440,84563,79552,82648],"id":11986},{"claim":"Florida is \"one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity.\"","claimant":"Jeb Bush","date":"2015-03-13","label":1,"related_articles":[9946,5402,5401,77259],"id":11994},{"claim":"Says her actions as Wisconsin commerce secretary brought the state \"84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today.\"","claimant":"Mary Burke","date":"2013-10-07","label":1,"related_articles":[80827,80783,80850,80826],"id":11998},{"claim":"If you sign up for Equifax's credit-monitoring service, you cannot join any class-action lawsuit against the company.","claimant":"","date":"2017-09-27","label":1,"related_articles":[122512,129690,130671,136878,137165,143647,145528],"id":12011},{"claim":"\"Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years.\"","claimant":"Facebook posts","date":"2014-06-16","label":0,"related_articles":[87995,1902,86340,20828],"id":12012},{"claim":"Says Wisconsin \"doesn't even give\" released prison inmates \"a bus ticket to get home.\"","claimant":"Kathleen Vinehout","date":"2018-05-01","label":1,"related_articles":[69401,77186,5212,90458],"id":12015},{"claim":"\"NASA confirms Earth will experience 15 days of darkness In November 2017.\"","claimant":"Bloggers","date":"2017-06-02","label":0,"related_articles":[10148,96977,41350,26770,11955],"id":12024},{"claim":"\"The so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk ... actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport.
